## 👋 About Me

I’m Akinbode Elijah, a Business Administration student with a deep passion for Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking. I combine my understanding of business risks with technical security testing to help identify and reduce vulnerabilities that could impact organizations.

I enjoy working on real-world security labs, performing penetration testing, OSINT research, and vulnerability analysis to understand how attacks happen and how to prevent them.

I’m constantly learning new tools and improving my skills in areas like network security, web application testing, and threat assessment — aiming to build a career that connects business strategy with cyber defense.


<!--Mention your top/relevant skills here - core and soft skills-->
## 💼 What I Do

*I work on ethical hacking and cybersecurity projects, focusing on finding and understanding security weaknesses in systems, websites, and networks. I use tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, and WhatWeb to test and analyze vulnerabilities.

I enjoy doing information gathering (OSINT), vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing to see how real attacks happen and how to stop them. I also create reports and security summaries to explain risks clearly and show how they can be fixed.

Everything I do is about learning, improving, and building practical cybersecurity skills that connect both the technical and business side of security..*

## 🚀 Skills & Tools:

I work with a wide range of cybersecurity tools and techniques that help me test, analyze, and secure systems. My main skills include information gathering, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and web application security.

I utilize tools such as Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nikto, Wapiti, Wireshark, WhatWeb, and Bettercap to identify and comprehend vulnerabilities in networks and web applications.

I’m also experienced with OSINT tools such as WHOIS, dig, and Shodan for collecting background information before testing. On the reporting side, I create vulnerability reports, threat assessments, and incident summaries to clearly explain risks and solutions.

## MY PORTFOLIO 

# 👋 Hi — A glimpse of my security & pentest work

Below are featured projects showing methodology, tools, and downloadable reports.

--
**📂 Featured Projects**

## 🕵️ Vulnerability Assessment – Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), Cisco

Reconnaissance: WHOIS, DNS, OSINT

Port scanning & enumeration: Nmap

Web application scanning: Wapiti, WhatWeb

Outcome: Identified web exposure and open ports

## ⚡ Penetration Test — Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC)
**Tools / Recon:** whois, dig/nslookup, theHarvester, subfinder, WhatWeb, nmap, wafw00f, gobuster, feroxbuster, nikto, nuclei, wpscan, sqlmap, curl, traceroute/ping, nc, theHarvester.  

**Summary:** Large subdomain footprint (~265+), several admin endpoints discovered, missing security headers, outdated JS libraries, and exposed endpoints that require remediation. Immediate recommendations: restrict admin interfaces, enable WAF rules, add security headers (CSP/HSTS), patch libraries, and conduct an authenticated pentest.
