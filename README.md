## ABOUT ME

Hello! I’m Akinbode Elijah, a Business Administration student with a passion for Cybersecurity. I’m building a career that combines business risk awareness with technical hands-on security testing.


<!--Mention your top/relevant skills here - core and soft skills-->
## WHAT I DO

*I specialize in ethical hacking and cybersecurity analysis, blending my business administration background with strong technical security skills.

I focus on identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing risks, and helping organizations strengthen their digital defenses. My goal is to bridge the gap between business risk management and technical security operations — understanding how attacks happen, why they matter, and how to prevent them.*

## Skills & Tools:

🕵️ Penetration Testing — I perform hands-on web and network pentests using tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, and OWASP ZAP to uncover vulnerabilities.

🌍 Information Gathering (OSINT) — I research domains and systems using WHOIS, dig, Shodan, and WhatWeb to gather intel before a test.

🔐 Vulnerability Assessment — I scan, identify, and report system weaknesses with professional tools like Nikto, Wapiti, and Wireshark.

🧠 Threat Analysis & Reporting — I analyze test results, interpret risks, and write professional vulnerability and threat assessment reports.

💻 Web App Security Labs — I set up controlled lab environments (DVWA, Juice Shop, etc.) to practice and demonstrate attacks such as SQLi, XSS, CSRF, and File Upload exploits.
